              <h3>Do I need a business plan to get a loan?</h3>
              <p>
                You may not need the typical business plan. The more important metric when it comes to business
                finance is your business history. Most of the companies who will offer you finance will require a 6-
                month track record of your business incomes and expenses.

              <h3>Do I need collateral?</h3>

              <h3>What is collateral?</h3>
              <p>
                Collateral is used for secured lending. It is simply another asset you have which is equal in value to
                the loan size you are asking for. A company that offers you business finance may ask for collateral.
                This will be necessary for them in the event that you are unable to repay your loan amount. It is at
                this point that they will be allowed to sell that collateral asset in exchange for the outstanding loan
                amount.
