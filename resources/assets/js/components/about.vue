          THIS IS ALL PLACE HOLDER TEXT
          PolyTherm has taken this need to heart. It is our promise to business owners to work hard at helping them gain access

          PolyTherm Business is part of the larger PolyTherm Group, known in South Africa as the biggest independent, free comparison
          website. PolyTherm has built and designed the business finance application process on this website so that South African
          businesses have a simple, fast, and trustworthy tool to source business finance.

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      <p>
        We have partnered with South Africaâ€™s biggest alternative lenders and it is our intention to match borrowers with the most
        appropriate form of finance for their business. Below is a simple summary of our How it works process. <nuxt-link to="/how-it-works">Click here</nuxt-link> to view
        the full process!
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of our partners has provided PolyTherm with details on the types of businesses they finance. We have taken this information
        and designed algorithms to match businesses with the most appropriate alternative financiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because our partners are not typical banks or financial institutions, they offer alternative finance options. Once you have
        gone through the application process, you will be presented with a comprehensive comparison of the business finance opportunities
        that match your funding criteria.

          <span class="highlight">Why</span> use PolyTherm instead of other direct business loan providers?
        </h1>
        <p>
          We are well positioned as one of the only independent business finance comparison websites in South Africa. Our goal is simple
          - we need to find you the most suitable form of finance at the lowest rate. Our proprietary backend and matching allocation
          algorithms have been built from the ground up to do the hard work for you.
